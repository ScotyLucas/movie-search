# Movie rating and search

This is my first real project with vite and i guess i did pretty great, <s>maybe i optimalize the search because now when you enter a letter its ask for respons for every letter :D but i made this at night.</s>
edit: i did the search optimalization but i totally forgot and last night didnt worked so i tought i didnt do it :D hehe

also if you want to run it you need a .env.local file like this:
  VITE_TMDB_API_KEY="<a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/">The movie DB API key</a>"(you need to register here)

Then you need to run in terminal:
npm i

Hope you have fun with it and make it greater the i could.
