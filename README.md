# Movie rating and search

This is my first real project with vite and i guess i did pretty great, maybe i optimalize the search because now when you enter a letter its ask for response and that not really great :D but i made this at night.

also if you want to run it you need a .env.local file like this:
  VITE_TMDB_API_KEY="The movie DB API key"

Then you need to run in terminal:
npm i

Hope you have fun with it and make it greater the i could.
